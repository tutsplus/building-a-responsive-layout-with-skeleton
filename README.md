### Tuts+ Tutorial Series: Building a Responsive Layout With Skeleton
#### Instructor: Ian Yates
#### Date: 2012

The Skeleton framework, by Dave Gamache, provides a simple and rapid way of kicking off a web build. With a straight-forward grid, clear typography, and very little else in the way of styling, Skeleton is arguably the lightest way of introducing yourself to responsive frameworks.

During this series of tutorials, we're going to design a Magazine blog layout, convert it for the browser, then build ourselves a functional WordPress theme from the result.
